title: 10 Biggest Threats of Cloud Computing
description: In recent years, cloud computing has brought about a paradigm shift
  in the technology real. Instead of storing and accessing data and programs
  using a computer’s hard drive, it can be carried out over the Internet, which
  is also known as the “cloud”. Users can use their data, programs, and services
  from the cloud anywhere, anytime. However, what seems like the perfect
  solution for remote working has several threats associated with it too.

In recent years, cloud computing has brought about a paradigm shift in the technology
realm. Instead of storing and accessing data and programs using a computer’s hard

can use their data, programs, and services from the cloud anywhere, anytime. However,
what seems like the perfect solution for remote working has several threats associated
with it too.

1. **Data Breach**<br/>
   A data breach occurs when sensitive or confidential information is released, viewed,
   stolen or used by entities who have access to the cloud network. It is usually the main
   objective of a planned cyber attack, but it could also be due to human error, application
   vulnerabilities or weak security implementations. Aside from losing data, businesses
   could also lose the trust of its customers, have its own intellectual property stolen or
   even face hefty penalties in accordance with data protection regulations.
2. **Misconfiguration of Cloud Resources**<br/>
   Misconfiguration occurs when cloud users set up their cloud resources incorrectly, such
   as having default credentials and configuration settings left unchanged. This often
   leaves the cloud user’s network to risk being exposed to a myriad of malicious activities,
   such as data breaches. It could also cause unintentional technical errors to happen,
   such as service interruptions between cloud resources that require communication with
   each other for running processes smoothly.
3. **Responsibility Ambiguity**<br/>
   Cloud users belonging to organizations typically have a role assigned to each of them
   based on their responsibilities for each project. A role contains a set of permissions that
   can be performed on specific cloud resources. If not clearly defined, user roles and
   responsibilities that are related to critical cloud operations, such as access control, may
   cause business or legal conflicts.
4. **Limited Cloud Usage Visibility**<br/>
   Limited cloud usage visibility occurs when an organization is unable to identify whether
   the cloud service used in its cloud network is safe or malicious. This can be broken
   down into two categories, namely invalid application use and valid application misuse.
   In most cases, it comes down to identifying valid and invalid users by determining if their
   actions are out of the norm or adhere to the organization’s corporate policies.
5. **Account Hijacking**<br/>
   Account hijacking happens when attackers gain unauthorized access to and abuse
   cloud user and service accounts for carrying out malicious activities. With stolen
   credentials, the attackers can view and manipulate sensitive and confidential
   information, exploit the vulnerabilities of applications and services in the cloud network,
   or even pose as the account user and launch cyberattacks on other targets. These can
   potentially cause significant disruption of the cloud network, such as data and asset loss
   and compromised operations.
6. **Insider Threats**<br/>
   Even with tight security measures in place to protect the organization’s cloud network
   from outside threats, insider threats still exist. Insiders refer to those who have
   authorised access to the organization’s cloud network and sensitive data, such as
   current or former employees, or trusted business partners. Intentional or not, their
   actions could result in the loss of proprietary information and intellectual property,
   system downtime due to cyberattacks or even customers losing confidence in the
   organization’s services.
7. **Loss of Control**<br/>
   Cloud providers and customers utilise a shared responsibility model, whereby the
   former handles the hardware and software, and the latter handles the security of data
   and assets in the cloud. Transferring a part of the organization’s own IT system to be
   managed in the cloud implies that the cloud service providers have been given partial
   control over it. Although the providers are typically unable to view customers’ sensitive
   and private data, some customers may feel uneasy and question the integrity and
   trustworthiness of the providers.
8. **Abuse of Cloud Services**<br/>
   To appeal to its customers better, cloud providers usually offer a myriad of attractive
   services such as an unlimited storage capacity. Some of them even offer free limited
   trial periods to use its offering of services. This gives an opportunity for cybercriminals
   to leverage on the free services for accessing the cloud immorally. With valid cloud
   access, they could then use these services as a launchpad for cyberattacks, or as a
   base for conducting other malicious activities that target users, organizations or other
   cloud providers.
9. **Availability of Services**<br/>
   Each cloud provider offers its own unique range of services that cater to the various
   needs of its customers. Some of these services may be managed by the cloud provider
   itself, while some others are managed by external service providers which created
   these services. Services may become unavailable due to updates conducted by its
   respective providers, cease of operation or even cyberattacks. When these happen,
   regular work processes and delivery of important workloads could get delayed, or the
   entire cloud system could get clogged up.
10. **Lack of Asset Management**<br/>
    One of the serious concerns customers have when engaging the services of cloud
    providers is asset management. Asset consists of not only customer data, but also
    other IT components such as hardware and software. With assets running in the cloud,
    it is imperative that cloud providers have the necessary and reliable asset management
    services available for customers to use, such as data backup and recovery software.
    Lack of asset management could potentially make the customer’s assets vulnerable to
    other malicious threats.
